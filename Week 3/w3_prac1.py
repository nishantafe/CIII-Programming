# Here you'll define two variables of different type
# and then try to divide one by the other.


# String cannot be divided by a float because that leads to a TypeError
# var1 = "30 hours to go"
var1 = 30
var2 = 2.5

total_amount = 0
apple_today = 20

# Now try to divide a string type
# by a float type. A TypeError
# will occur.
print(var1)
print(var2)
answer = var1 / var2

print(answer)

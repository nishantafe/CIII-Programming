# Comparison Operators
x = 5
y = 9

# Check if y is greater than x
print("x > y is ", x > y)

# Check if y is less than x
print("x < y is ", x < y)

# Now check if x and y are equal
print("x == y is ", x == y)

# Check if x and y are not equal
print("x != y is ", x != y)

# Check if x is greater than or equal to y
print("x >= y is ", x >= y)

# Check if x is less than or equal to y
print("x <= y is ", x <= y)
